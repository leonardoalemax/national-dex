## Technical overview:

This is a React App, so i've used `react-scripts` to generate it, is a simple app, so i've not yet decided to eject it from the script or not, lets keep this way for now.

I'm using `Redux`, with 2 middleware, the `redux-promise` and `redux-thunk`, the first one helps to execute the promises before the reducer been called, and the other helps to chain the actions.

For unit testing i'm using `Jest` with some little help of `mocha`, there's a setup file thats mocks all `axios` http calls, the file is on `/src/setupTests.js`. All the mocked jsons are in `/src/mocks`.
